  about: |
    Founded in 2010, White Label Security pioneered the concept of resellable security services for managed service providers (MSPs) and IT consultancies. The company developed a platform that allowed technology service providers to offer professional-grade security assessments, compliance services, and vulnerability management under their own brand, enabling smaller firms to compete with larger security consultancies.
  solutions:
    - White-labeled security assessment reports and templates
    - Compliance automation for PCI DSS, HIPAA, and other frameworks
    - Vulnerability scanning and management services
    - Security policy development tools
    - Client-facing security dashboards and portals
  impact: |
    White Label Security transformed how small and mid-sized IT service providers delivered security services to their clients. By democratizing access to enterprise-grade security tools and methodologies, they enabled hundreds of service providers to add security offerings to their portfolios without significant investment in specialized expertise or infrastructure. This approach helped extend professional security services to thousands of small and medium businesses that previously had limited access to such resources.
